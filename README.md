## About

rack-security is designed to be a simple Application Firewall which can easily be inserted into
any Rack compatible application as Middleware to protect your application from common security
threats.

It will provide protection against:

 * SQL Injection Attacks
 * NULL-Byte Injection Attacks

Eventually it will be expanded to provide comprehensive protection against most of the
[OWASP Top Ten][2] security threats for Web Applications.
